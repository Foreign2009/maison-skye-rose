## Log

### 2026-06-29 — AIOS-001 — Program Implementation

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** AIOS-001 — AI Engineering Operating System v1.0

**Decisions Made:**
- Do not create root-level files (`PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `CHATGPT.md`) — extend the existing `.ai/` system instead of replacing it
- Two new files approved: `.ai/SPRINT.md` and `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md`
- Two existing files extended: `CURRENT_TASK.md` (added `Program:` field) and `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` (added prompts 13–15)
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` staleness noted and deferred — not in AIOS-001 scope
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` structural overlap with `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` identified but deferred — no refactor in this sprint

**Tasks Completed:**
- Audited all 10 existing `.ai/` files — produced capability map, file-by-file assessment, and gap analysis
- Created `.ai/SPRINT.md` — Engineering Program Management
- Created `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` — Session History (this file)
- Extended `CURRENT_TASK.md` with `Program:` field
- Extended `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` with prompts 13–15 (Open Program, Close Program, Program Review)

**Tasks Started:** None pending — all AIOS-001 tasks complete.

**Build Result:** N/A — `.ai/` infrastructure files only. No application code changed. No build required.

**Files Changed:**
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (created)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (created)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (extended — `Program:` field added to template)
- `.ai/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` (extended — prompts 13–15 added)

**Handoff:** AIOS-001 closed. AI-OS v1.0 scaffold complete. Next Engineering Program to be defined by Project Owner and ChatGPT.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` build status is stale (last updated 2026-06-27, build result "Unknown") — recommend a maintenance refresh at the start of the next program
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` duplicates issue data from `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — structural overlap deferred to a future engineering program if it causes maintenance problems

### 2026-06-30 — EP3-P1 — Knowledge Engineering / Intelligence Layer Validation & Close

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP3-P1 — Knowledge Engineering (EP3-P1A: Evaluation Framework; Intelligence Layer integration validation)

**Decisions Made:**
- Capture evaluation baseline before any repository cleanup (G4 constraint)
- Treat `app/quiz/page.tsx` uncommitted change as part of EP3-P1 (Intelligence Layer), not EP3-P2 — commit before opening next program
- Defer TC-E2E-01 and TC-E2E-02 browser entries in `baseline-results.md` to G5 browser validation session (now complete — see supplementary entry in baseline-results.md below)
- QuickAddModal Escape key behaviour (D5) intentionally deferred — pre-existing component behaviour, not introduced by this diff; no fix in scope
- Mobile WhatsApp floating button overlay noted as pre-existing cosmetic issue; deferred

**Tasks Completed:**
- G4: Created `.ai/evaluation/` directory with four documents: `recommendation-suite.md`, `quality-metrics.md`, `evaluation-procedure.md`, `baseline-results.md`
- Repository Evidence Report: confirmed quiz page change belongs to EP3-P1 Intelligence Layer, is internally consistent, and is ready to commit
- G5 Build Verification: `npm run build` — Pass. Zero TypeScript errors. Zero warnings. `/quiz` compiles as Static.
- G5 Browser Validation: 46/46 checklist items pass (sections A–H). Runtime Risks R1–R5 not reproduced as problems.
- Committed `app/quiz/page.tsx` — Intelligence Layer integration (commit 225770f)
- Pushed `.ai/evaluation/` framework to remote (committed in prior session: evaluation framework push)

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, `/quiz` Static, `/shop` Static

**Files Changed:**
- `app/quiz/page.tsx` (modified — Intelligence Layer integration, committed 225770f)
- `.ai/evaluation/recommendation-suite.md` (created)
- `.ai/evaluation/quality-metrics.md` (created)
- `.ai/evaluation/evaluation-procedure.md` (created)
- `.ai/evaluation/baseline-results.md` (created)

**Handoff:** EP3-P1 closed. Intelligence Layer is fully integrated across both quiz and shop pages. Evaluation framework is in place. Next program (EP3-P2) to be defined by Engineering Lead.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- QuickAddModal: no Escape key handler — closes via Cancel only. Pre-existing. Deferred.
- Mobile: floating WhatsApp button partially overlays question heading at 375px. Pre-existing cosmetic. Deferred.
- M3 Adapter Coverage metric: deferred (requires code execution against full catalogue). Measure at next evaluation run.
- TC-E2E-01 and TC-E2E-02 now confirmed via G5 browser validation (see baseline-results.md supplementary entry — to be appended).

### 2026-06-30 — EP3-P2 — Knowledge Engineering / Dead Occasion Signal

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP3-P2 — Knowledge Engineering (Dead Occasion Signal investigation and resolution)

**Decisions Made:**
- Resolve only the quiz UI exposure of the dead signal; do not modify parser, adapter, engine, or vocabulary
- Preserve "Luxury Events" in `fragranceOccasions.ts` to keep the shop path and future Option 3 path operational
- Defer Gym, Clubbing, Signature Scent dead signals — not exposed in quiz; require authoritative catalogue data (Option 3) to resolve correctly
- Option 4 (profile/vibe inference) assessed as partially feasible: Gym viable, Clubbing marginal, Luxury Events insufficient discriminating power (42% coverage), Signature Scent not feasible under any proxy
- Minimal change approved: remove "Luxury Events" from `quiz/page.tsx` options only

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: complete data flow mapped (Parser→11 occasions, Adapter→7 occasions); 4 dead signals identified; product counts by season confirmed
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 4 options evaluated (reduce vocabulary, extend SEASON_OCCASIONS, authoritative metadata, profile/vibe inference); recommendation: Option 1 now + Option 3 when data is ready
- G2A Option 4 Feasibility Assessment: computed product counts and overlaps across all 93 products; Luxury Events=39 (42%), Clubbing=13 (14%), Gym=22 (24%), Signature Scent=19 (20%); identified inappropriate assignments and proxy limitations
- G3 Implementation Plan: single-line deletion approved
- G4 Implementation: `app/quiz/page.tsx` — "Luxury Events" removed from occasion options
- Build verification: Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings
- Browser validation: 9/9 pass — all 4 remaining occasions produce results, dead signal confirmed absent from DOM, shop vocabulary path confirmed intact
- Committed (65b243d), AI-OS records updated, pushed

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, `/quiz` Static

**Files Changed:**
- `app/quiz/page.tsx` (modified — 1 line deleted, committed 65b243d)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP3-P2 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP3-P2 closed. Dead Occasion Signal (Luxury Events) removed from quiz UI. Vocabulary intact. All other dead occasions deferred pending Option 3 (authoritative catalogue occasion metadata).

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Gym, Clubbing, Signature Scent: dead signals still exist in adapter layer. Not exposed via quiz (no action required now). Require authoritative occasion data (Option 3) for full resolution.
- Option 3 follow-up: add `occasions?: string[]` to `DisplayFragrance`, populate across 93 catalogue products, update `adaptFragrance` to prefer catalogue data over SEASON_OCCASIONS derivation. When complete, re-add "Luxury Events" (and others) to quiz options.
- Evaluation framework: no new baseline entry created for EP3-P2 (single-line UI change; engine behaviour unchanged; existing baseline remains valid).

### 2026-06-30 — EP4-P1A — Discovery Experience / Signal Awareness

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP4 — Discovery Experience (EP4-P1A: Signal Awareness — first increment)

**Decisions Made:**
- Option 4 (Hybrid Experience) selected from G2 Engineering Assessment: signal summary above ProductCard grid preserves purchase flow while adding intelligence feedback
- First increment scope: signal pills only — no per-card explainability, no matchStrength badges, no ProductCard changes
- Label text "Curated for you:" approved as customer-facing brand-appropriate copy
- Pill render order: Gender → Occasion → Family → Vibe → Character
- Pre-existing Mode 2 bug discovered during implementation: approved as in-scope defect fix
- Mode 2 bug root cause: `parseIntent` assigns `signals.family/vibe/occasion` explicitly as `undefined`, making `Object.keys(signals).length` always > 0 for non-empty queries. Mode 2 (keyword fallback) never fired in original code. Fixed by checking `Object.values(signals).some((v) => v !== undefined)` instead.

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: complete discovery pipeline mapped, 8 existing components assessed, explainability gap identified
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 4 options evaluated; Option 4 (Hybrid) recommended and approved
- G3 Implementation Plan: Signal Awareness increment planned and approved with 2 Engineering Lead refinements
- G4 Implementation: `app/shop/page.tsx` — `detectedSignals` useMemo, `GENDER_LABELS`, `filtered` memo refactored, signal summary JSX block inserted
- Mode 2 bug fix: `Object.keys` → `Object.values(...).some` for hasSignals check
- Build verification: Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings
- Browser validation: 16/16 PASS — all signal dimensions, pill order, count accuracy, mobile layout, ProductCard regression
- Commit 93c60af, pushed to origin/main

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, `/shop` Static

**Files Changed:**
- `app/shop/page.tsx` (modified — Signal Awareness implementation + Mode 2 bug fix, committed 93c60af)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP4-P1A added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP4-P1A closed. Signal Awareness live in production. Intelligence Layer signals now visible to customers in shop search. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for EP4-P1B or next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- EP4 next increment: per-card `matchStrength` badge or full reasons (requires ProductCard API change — separate engineering gate)
- EP4 slot grouping (Option 2 from G2): "Best Match" / "Similar Matches" section headers — complementary to Signal Awareness, not yet planned
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent

---

### 2026-06-30 — EP4-P1B — Discovery Experience / Match Strength

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP4 — Discovery Experience (EP4-P1B: Match Strength — second increment)

**Decisions Made:**
- Scope restricted to positional confidence label above first recommendation card only — no ProductCard changes, no badge, no signal summary extension
- Customer-facing terminology: "strong" → "Perfect Match"; "moderate" → "Great Match"; "partial" → suppressed
- Label restricted to default ("Featured") sort order only — non-default sort suppresses the label to preserve semantic meaning of "Perfect Match" / "Great Match"
- `adaptedByTitle` Map added at module scope (mirrors existing `displayByTitle` pattern) to bridge DisplayFragrance → Fragrance for `generateReasons` lookup
- `firstCardStrength` useMemo placed after `displayItems` memo — depends on `[detectedSignals, sortBy, displayItems]`
- First card wrapped in `<div>` grid cell with label `<p>` above it; all other cards remain direct grid children

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas assessed — matchStrength generation, consumption gap, ProductCard extension points, RecommendationCard, shop pipeline, styling patterns, reusable components, risks, mobile layout, architectural constraints
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 4 options evaluated (badge in card, grid-level indicator, inline text, hybrid); Option 4 (Hybrid) recommended and approved; customer-facing terminology proposed
- G3 Implementation Plan: positional label only; sort suppression guard; 8-point Definition of Done
- G4 Implementation: `app/shop/page.tsx` — import, `adaptedByTitle` Map, `firstCardStrength` useMemo, grid render update
- Build verification: Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, `/shop` Static
- Browser validation: 16/16 PASS — Mode 0/2 suppression, Perfect Match, Great Match, position accuracy, sort suppression and restore, EP4-P1A regression, mobile layout, zero-results guard
- Commit bdabd75, pushed to origin/main

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, `/shop` Static

**Files Changed:**
- `app/shop/page.tsx` (modified — confidence label implementation, committed bdabd75)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP4-P1B added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP4-P1B closed. Confidence label live in production. Intelligence Layer matchStrength now customer-visible as "Perfect Match" / "Great Match" above the top recommendation card in Mode 1 with Featured ordering. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for EP4-P1C or next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- EP4 next direction: slot grouping (Best Match / Similar Matches section headers), ShopByVibe functional wiring, ShopByPersonality pre-seeded intent — not yet planned
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-06-30 — EP4-P1C — Discovery Experience / Explainability (Investigation)

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP4 — Discovery Experience (EP4-P1C: Explainability — engineering investigation, no production changes)

**Decisions Made:**
- EP4-P1C concluded as an engineering investigation with no implementation approved
- Per-card reasons: ruled out — `FALLBACK_REASONS` unconditional guarantee produces generic strings ("Recommended by Maison AI", "Carefully curated for your style") for partial-match cards; displaying these as product-specific explanations undermines intelligence credibility; suppressing partials creates visual inconsistency across the grid
- Single above-grid explanation: assessed as architecturally sound but providing limited additional value over the EP4-P1A signal pills already in place; risks redundancy and templated feel from `generateReasons` string templates
- No implementation: EP4-P1A (signal pills) and EP4-P1B (confidence label) together provide a complete discovery narrative; reasons belong at the product detail level (RecommendationCard on PDP), not the discovery level (shop grid)
- FALLBACK_REASONS design validated as appropriate for ProductDetail context (full expanded RecommendationCard); unsuitable for shop grid context where reasons would be the primary differentiating text

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas assessed — generateReasons implementation, ExplanationResult generation, reasons consumption, ProductCard extension points, RecommendationCard, shop pipeline, UI patterns, mobile layout, risks, reuse opportunities
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 3 approaches evaluated (per-card reasons, single explanation block, no change); FALLBACK_REASONS unsuitability confirmed; Approach 3 (no additional explainability) recommended and approved

**Build Result:** N/A — no production code changed

**Files Changed:**
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP4-P1C added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP4-P1C closed. No production changes. Intelligence Layer explainability system fully assessed. Reasons remain active on Product Detail pages via RecommendationCard. Shop discovery explainability complete at EP4-P1A + EP4-P1B level. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- EP4 next direction: slot grouping, ShopByVibe wiring, ShopByPersonality pre-seeded intent — not yet planned
- If `generateReasons` is extended in a future sprint to distinguish genuine from fallback reasons (e.g. a `hasGenuineReasons` flag), per-card reasons in the shop could be revisited
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-06-30 — EP5-P1 — Curated Discovery / Recommendation Slot Semantics

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP5 — Curated Discovery (EP5-P1: Slot Semantics Correction)

**Decisions Made:**
- `luxuryUpgrade` criterion changed from popularity-based bestseller filter (`popularity >= 9`) to Elite collection selection (`collection === "Elite"`): Elite is the authoritative luxury tier; bestseller status is not a luxury signal; all 5 Elite products were previously excluded from the slot named for them
- `hiddenGem` corrected from lowest-scoring non-bestseller (`[...scored].reverse().find(...)`) to highest-scoring standard non-bestseller (`scored.slice(1).find(...)`): the original `.reverse()` inverted the intent — a hidden gem should align with preferences, not contradict them
- Both slots use `.slice(1)` to exclude `bestMatch` from consideration — prevents same product appearing in multiple slots
- Fallbacks changed from `|| scored[1]` / `|| scored[2]` (could return semantically wrong products) to `|| null` (slot renders absent rather than misleading)
- Engineering Lead refinement at G4→Engineering Refinement gate: `gender === "unisex"` rejected as Elite proxy; `collection` propagated directly through adapter as pass-through field (not a derived `tier` abstraction)
- `collection?: "Skye" | "Rose" | "Elite"` added to `Fragrance` type — follows existing pattern of `bestSeller?` and `newArrival?` optional pass-through fields
- `QuizResults.tsx` noted as defined but not currently imported anywhere in the live app — slot labels are not yet customer-visible; this component is the candidate surface for future slot-based discovery UI

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: slot definitions, knowledgeAdapter popularity model, all four consumers assessed
- G2 Engineering Assessment: all four slots evaluated (engineering meaning, customer meaning, accuracy, risks); binary popularity model deficiencies confirmed; four presentation approaches evaluated; Approach C (refine slot logic) recommended and approved
- G3 Implementation Plan: Work Item A (hiddenGem) and Work Item B (luxuryUpgrade) planned; luxury signal audit confirmed price is uniform (no price differentiation), collection is the only authoritative premium signal
- G4 Implementation: single-file change to `app/lib/recommendFragrances.ts`; build pass; 10-scenario browser validation; 4-trace slot correctness verification; EP4 regression confirmed absent
- Engineering Refinement: `gender === "unisex"` replaced with `collection === "Elite"` using direct collection pass-through; three-file change (`types.ts`, `knowledgeAdapter.ts`, `recommendFragrances.ts`)
- Build verification: Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages
- Commit d830e6f, pushed to origin/main

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 static/dynamic pages unchanged

**Files Changed:**
- `app/data/types.ts` (modified — `collection?` field added)
- `app/lib/knowledgeAdapter.ts` (modified — `collection` pass-through added; stale comment updated)
- `app/lib/recommendFragrances.ts` (modified — `luxuryUpgrade` and `hiddenGem` slot expressions corrected)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP5-P1 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP5-P1 closed. Recommendation slot semantics are now aligned with their business meaning. Hidden Gem selects the best-matching underrated standard fragrance. Luxury Upgrade selects the best-matching Elite collection product. No regressions. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for EP5-P2 or next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Technical consistency opportunity: `hiddenGem` currently excludes Elite via `item.gender !== "unisex"` — could be updated to `item.collection !== "Elite"` for architectural consistency with `luxuryUpgrade`. No functional change required. Low priority.
- `QuizResults.tsx` exists with correct slot label sections but is not imported in any page — candidate for future slot-based discovery UI when Engineering Lead determines the right moment
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-06-30 — EP6-P1 — Intelligence Analytics / Analytics Architecture

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP6 — Intelligence Analytics (EP6-P1: Analytics Architecture — infrastructure only)

**Decisions Made:**
- Analytics observes behaviour; it never influences it — enforced as a documentation principle and architectural rule in `analytics.ts`
- Intelligence Layer must never import `analytics.ts` — observability lives at call sites in consumers, not inside pure library functions
- Provider selection deferred — provider integration point implemented as named stub (`providerInit`, `providerCapture`); no provider SDK installed, no env var hard-coded
- Session identity: anonymous UUID in `localStorage['msr_session_id']` — consistent with existing cart and favorites persistence pattern; generated via `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Timestamps are provider responsibility — client payloads carry no timestamp fields
- `SESSION_KEY = "msr_session_id"` defined as module constant in `AnalyticsInit.tsx` — no literal repetition
- G5 Engineering Lead refinement: `if (!ready) return;` required as explicit first statement in every public track function body — the `capture` helper retains its own guard as secondary defense; public contract must be self-documenting
- `AnalyticsInit` component placed outside the provider tree in `layout.tsx` — no context dependencies; renders `null`
- Approach B (Shared Analytics Service) selected from four evaluated architectures — matches codebase thin-module convention, centralizes schema ownership, testable via single module mock, sufficient portability for pre-launch single-provider context
- Stage 2 (application instrumentation) deferred — 16 insertion points enumerated and ordered in G3 plan; no application components touched

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas surveyed — analytics/telemetry (none), event handling, shop flow, quiz flow, search flow, product click flow, cart flow, ProductDetail flow, routing, Supabase; 16 instrumentation points identified; architectural constraints documented
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 4 architectures evaluated (A: Direct calls, B: Service module, C: Interface/adapter, D: Event bus); 10 topics assessed (abstraction layer, event model, provider adapter, session identity, schema, client/server split, ProductCard propagation, API boundaries, failure handling, portability); Approach B recommended and approved
- G3 Implementation Plan: Stage 1 (infrastructure) fully planned; Stage 2 (instrumentation) insertion points listed in priority order without internal code
- G4 Implementation: `app/lib/analytics.ts` created (documentation block, safeCall, ready flag, provider stub, 10 payload types, 12 track functions); `app/components/AnalyticsInit.tsx` created; `app/layout.tsx` modified; 9/9 browser validation pass
- G5 Refinement: explicit `if (!ready) return;` added to all 12 track function bodies; build pass; 9/9 validation reconfirmed; committed abf512e

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages (unchanged)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/analytics.ts` (created — analytics service module)
- `app/components/AnalyticsInit.tsx` (created — initialization component)
- `app/layout.tsx` (modified — AnalyticsInit added)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP6-P1 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP6-P1 closed. Analytics infrastructure is in place. Session identity is operational. Intelligence Layer remains isolated. No application component is instrumented. Stage 2 instrumentation requires provider selection before implementation can begin.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Provider selection: PostHog JS recommended in G2; Engineering Lead to confirm before Stage 2
- Stage 2 (instrumentation): 16 insertion points enumerated in G3 plan; ready to implement once provider is selected and configured
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-06-30 — EP6-P2 — Intelligence Analytics / Discovery Instrumentation

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP6 — Intelligence Analytics (EP6-P2: Discovery Instrumentation)

**Decisions Made:**
- `AnalyticsSource` extracted as a shared exported type from `analytics.ts` — single source of truth for source string union; no duplication in `ProductCard` or application components
- Approach A (individual optional props) selected for `ProductCard` analytics context — `source?` and `rank?` as scalar optionals; avoids object creation that would break `memo(ProductCard)` referential stability
- `handleProductNavigation` useCallback replaces both `Link onClick={saveRecentlyViewed}` assignments — combines `saveRecentlyViewed` + conditional `trackProductClick`; analytics call guarded by `source !== undefined` so non-shop usages of `ProductCard` are unaffected
- Mode is derived as `currentMode` useMemo (0 | 1 | 2) — DRY derivation shared by filter/sort handlers, useEffects, and `analyticsSource` const; avoids repeating `debouncedSearch`/`detectedSignals` logic
- Two separate useEffects: discovery mode events on `[debouncedSearch, detectedSignals]`; confidence events on `[firstCardStrength]` — separation keeps each effect's responsibility clear
- `analyticsSource` computed as explicit ternary const (no template literal) per Engineering Lead refinement #1
- State updates always precede analytics calls in all inline handlers per Engineering Lead refinement #2
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` — not suppressed proactively; build confirmed zero warnings; no suppression required
- Intelligence Layer remains analytics-free — `recommendFragrances`, `intentParser`, `knowledgeAdapter`, `explainability` carry no analytics imports

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas surveyed — Discovery pipeline, all three modes, search lifecycle, shop rendering pipeline, ProductCard context, existing analytics integration points, event opportunities, architectural risks, dependencies
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 3 ProductCard context approaches evaluated (A: individual props, B: analyticsContext object, C: parent owns click); Approach A recommended and approved; 10 topics assessed including useEffect strategy, memo safety, ESLint exhaustive-deps
- G3 Implementation Plan: 3-file plan approved; `AnalyticsSource` shared type refinement added by Engineering Lead
- G4 Implementation: 3 files modified — `analytics.ts` (AnalyticsSource type), `ProductCard.tsx` (source/rank props, handleProductNavigation), `shop/page.tsx` (currentMode, 2 useEffects, filter/sort instrumentation, analyticsSource const, ProductCard source/rank props); build pass; 31/31 browser validation; Intelligence Layer isolation confirmed; committed bfbce8d

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages (unchanged)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/analytics.ts` (modified — AnalyticsSource type extracted from ProductPayload)
- `app/components/ProductCard.tsx` (modified — source/rank props, handleProductNavigation)
- `app/shop/page.tsx` (modified — currentMode, discovery/confidence useEffects, filter/sort instrumentation, analyticsSource const, ProductCard source/rank)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP6-P2 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP6-P2 closed. Discovery instrumentation complete. All five event types (discovery mode, confidence, filter, sort, product click) are instrumented and analytics-safe. ProductCard accepts analytics context without breaking memoization. Intelligence Layer remains isolated. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for EP6-P3 or next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Provider selection: PostHog JS recommended in EP6-P1 G2; still pending Engineering Lead confirmation
- Future engineering note: when additional discovery surfaces are instrumented, consider introducing a shared helper for analytics source construction to avoid duplicated source selection logic. Do not implement now.
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-06-30 — EP6-P3 — Intelligence Analytics / Quiz Instrumentation

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP6 — Intelligence Analytics (EP6-P3: Quiz Instrumentation)

**Decisions Made:**
- No `quiz_started` event — repository has no authoritative started state; first `quiz_answer_selected` is the funnel entry point
- `trackQuizAnswer` placed inline in `handleAnswer` (not in a useEffect) — direct user-action observation; `questionId` and `answer` naturally available at call site
- `isNew` check (`answers[questionId] === undefined`) distinguishes first-time answers from re-answers for correct `completionCount` derivation; both fire the event
- State update (`setAnswers`) precedes analytics call (`trackQuizAnswer`) — consistent with EP6-P2 handler pattern
- `useEffect([completed])` for `quiz_completed` — `completed` is monotonically increasing (0→5), reaches 5 exactly once per session; natural one-shot pattern requiring no `useRef` deduplication
- `useEffect([recommended])` with `useRef<boolean>(false)` guard for `quiz_results_shown` — "first completed recommendation set shown"; subsequent re-answer updates intentionally not tracked; Engineering Lead refinement: document guard intent with comment
- `source="quiz"` passed to ProductCard — activates existing EP6-P2 `handleProductNavigation` mechanism; no changes to `ProductCard.tsx`
- Both inline WhatsApp CTAs instrumented — "Need Help Choosing?" (`ctaType: "help"`) and "Send My Results To WhatsApp" (`ctaType: "results"` with top-3 titles); `FloatingWhatsApp` not instrumented (shared component, no quiz context)
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` — neither effect triggered warnings at build time; no suppressions required
- Intelligence Layer remains analytics-free

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas surveyed — quiz lifecycle, question model, recommendation flow, existing UI, ProductCard usage vs shop, analytics opportunities, event timing, architectural boundaries, dependencies, risks
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 10 topics assessed — answer instrumentation, completion detection, result observation, ProductCard, WhatsApp CTAs, re-answer behaviour, one-shot guards, result deduplication, React effect strategy, testing strategy; decisions deferred to Engineering Lead on result deduplication scope
- G3 Implementation Plan: single-file plan (`app/quiz/page.tsx`); 9 work items; hook strategy, ESLint dep analysis, validation plan, regression risks, Definition of Done
- G4 Implementation: `app/quiz/page.tsx` modified — useEffect/useRef added to React import, analytics imports, hasTrackedResults ref, handleAnswer augmentation, completion effect, results effect with documentation comment, ProductCard source/rank, two WhatsApp onClick handlers; build pass; 28/28 browser validation; Intelligence Layer isolation confirmed; committed 53c4c63

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages (unchanged)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/quiz/page.tsx` (modified — quiz analytics instrumentation, committed 53c4c63)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP6-P3 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP6-P3 closed. Quiz instrumentation complete. Five event types operational in the quiz journey: `quiz_answer_selected`, `quiz_completed`, `quiz_results_shown`, `quiz_whatsapp_clicked`, `product_clicked` (via ProductCard reuse). Intelligence Layer remains isolated. EP6 analytics instrumentation now covers Shop (EP6-P2) and Quiz (EP6-P3). Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for EP6-P4 or next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Provider selection: PostHog JS recommended in EP6-P1 G2; still pending Engineering Lead confirmation
- Future engineering note: as additional customer journeys are instrumented, consider introducing a shared helper or constants for analytics source construction to avoid duplicated source-selection logic. Do not implement now.
- `QuickAddModal.handleAddToCart` is an uninstrumented add-to-cart path — `trackAddToCart` exists in `analytics.ts` but is not called from anywhere; cross-surface scope (shop, quiz, PDP); candidate for a future EP6 sprint
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)

### 2026-07-01 — EP6-P4 — Intelligence Analytics / Commerce Instrumentation

**Participants:** Project Owner / Claude (Implementation Engineer) / ChatGPT (Engineering Lead)
**Program:** EP6 — Intelligence Analytics (EP6-P4: Commerce Instrumentation)

**Decisions Made:**
- PayFast return pages describe observed application navigation behaviour only — NOT payment confirmation; event names are `payment_return_success` and `payment_return_cancelled`, never `payment_success`
- `product_detail_viewed` extends the existing `recentlyViewed` useEffect — no second mount effect introduced
- MiniCart quick-add uses `source: "minicart"` only — no additional MiniCart source values
- `deliveryMethod: province` included in `checkout_started` payload — province state already existed in CheckoutPage; no new UI or calculations introduced
- EP6-P4 scope limited to 9 events — `remove_from_cart` and `cart_quantity_changed` deferred
- `!cartOpen` guard prevents `cart_opened` event from firing when cart is already open — applied at both Navbar bag-icon and ProductDetail post-add call sites
- SessionStorage guards prevent payment return events re-firing on page refresh — named constants (`PAYMENT_RETURN_SUCCESS_KEY`, `PAYMENT_RETURN_CANCELLED_KEY`) declared at module level in each payment return page
- `trackProductView` payload kept minimal — `title` and `collection` only; no expansion of existing schema
- Intelligence Layer remains analytics-free — `recommendFragrances`, `intentParser`, `knowledgeAdapter`, `explainability` carry zero analytics imports

**Tasks Completed:**
- G1 Repository Evidence Report: 10 areas surveyed — Product Detail lifecycle, Cart lifecycle, Checkout lifecycle, existing analytics API, ProductCard usage, event opportunities, event timing, architectural boundaries, dependencies, risks
- G2 Engineering Assessment: 12 topics assessed — instrumentation strategy across all commerce surfaces; PayFast boundary constraint documented; sessionStorage guard pattern selected
- G3 Implementation Plan: 9-event plan approved; 8-file scope defined; sessionStorage named constants refinement applied; `deliveryMethod: province` confirmed as existing state
- G4 Implementation: 8 production files modified — `analytics.ts` (CartPayload.source extended; 5 new payload types; 6 new track functions), `ProductDetail.tsx` (imports, cartOpen destructure, useEffect extension, handleAddToCart, handleBuyNow), `QuickAddModal.tsx` (trackAddToCart), `MiniCart.tsx` (trackAddToCart × 3 surfaces, trackWhatsAppCheckout), `Navbar.tsx` (trackCartOpened bag-icon), `checkout/page.tsx` (trackCheckoutStarted, trackPaymentStarted), `payment-success/page.tsx` (sessionStorage guard, trackPaymentReturnSuccess), `payment-cancel/page.tsx` (sessionStorage guard, trackPaymentReturnCancelled)
- Build verification: Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages (unchanged)
- Browser validation: 35/35 scenarios pass across 15 groups — all commerce events, Intelligence Layer isolation, EP6-P2/P3 regressions confirmed
- Committed 7da817e — `feat(analytics): instrument commerce analytics`

**Tasks Started:** None pending — all EP6-P4 tasks complete.

**Build Result:** Pass — zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, 118 pages (unchanged)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/analytics.ts` (modified — CartPayload.source extended; 5 new payload types; 6 new track functions)
- `app/components/ProductDetail.tsx` (modified — analytics imports; cartOpen destructure; useEffect extension; handleAddToCart; handleBuyNow)
- `app/components/QuickAddModal.tsx` (modified — trackAddToCart)
- `app/components/MiniCart.tsx` (modified — trackAddToCart × 3 quick-add surfaces; trackWhatsAppCheckout)
- `app/components/Navbar.tsx` (modified — trackCartOpened bag-icon)
- `app/checkout/page.tsx` (modified — trackCheckoutStarted; trackPaymentStarted)
- `app/payment-success/page.tsx` (modified — sessionStorage guard; trackPaymentReturnSuccess)
- `app/payment-cancel/page.tsx` (modified — sessionStorage guard; trackPaymentReturnCancelled)
- `.ai/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` (this entry)
- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (updated)
- `.ai/SPRINT.md` (EP6-P4 added to Completed Programs)

**Handoff:** EP6-P4 closed. Commerce analytics instrumentation complete. Analytics now covers the full customer journey: Discovery (EP6-P2), Quiz (EP6-P3), and Commerce (EP6-P4). Intelligence Layer remains isolated. Awaiting Engineering Lead direction for next sprint.

**Open Questions Carried Forward:**
- Provider selection: PostHog JS recommended in EP6-P1 G2; still pending Engineering Lead confirmation
- Future engineering note: As analytics coverage expands beyond commerce, consider introducing shared constants (or a helper) for analytics source values to prevent vocabulary drift. Do not implement during EP6.
- `remove_from_cart` and `cart_quantity_changed`: deferred — not in EP6-P4 scope; candidate for a future sprint
- ShopByVibe functional wiring: vibe tiles have no onClick/search injection (decorative only)
- ShopByPersonality routing: all personality cards link to /quiz rather than /shop?q= with pre-seeded intent
- Deferred: QuickAddModal Escape key (pre-existing UX issue)
- Deferred: Mobile WhatsApp button overlay (pre-existing cosmetic issue)
